# OpenAlex open source code repositories

[OpenAlex](https://openalex.org) is an open, comprehensive catalog of scholarship, connecting papers, authors, institutions, and journals. 

Because we think all research should be free and open, OpenAlex is free and open itself, and we're built on a fully Open Source codebase.

Below is a list of the open-source code used to build, deploy, and document OpenAlex:

- [openalex-guts](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-guts): The guts for computing data for OpenAlex
- [openalex-elastic-api](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-elastic-api): All the OpenAlex API endpoints that are backed by Elasticsearch 
- [openalex-docs](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-docs): The GitBook documentation site for OpenAlex 
- [openalex-gui](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-gui): Website for OpenAlex.org
- [openalex-api-tutorials](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-api-tutorials): A collection of Jupyter notebooks, each walking you through a common example of bibliometric analysis using scholarly data from the OpenAlex API
- [openalex-ngrams-api](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-ngrams-api): API for ngrams available through OpenAlex
- [openalex-elasticsearch](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-elasticsearch): Code and templates for setting up the Elasticsearch backend for the slice-and-dice API
